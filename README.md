# Partition-Assisted-K-Nearest-Neighbors
# Overview
This is a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a partitioning system to improve efficiency. The partitioning system divides the coordinate system into smaller parts or partitions, and then KNN is computed on each partition separately. This helps to overcome the issues of the KNN algorithm when we have a large amount of data or when we have fewer points than the number of K.

# Features
- Fast and efficient computation of KNN using a partitioning system.
- Ability to handle large datasets without sacrificing accuracy.
- Easy to understand and implement.
